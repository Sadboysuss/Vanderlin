<p><br></p>
<p>   Oh Necra, our Goddess
Your mercifulness is beyond us
We have more nor less
We curse all around us
  </p>
<p><br></p>
<br>
<p>   Oh Necra, our Mother
<br>
Those that have gone await for you
<br>
Bargaining with a coin
<br>
While we await to go with you. </p>
<p><br></p>
<br>
<p>  So we pray in silence
<br> 
And we cry in silence,
<br>
so you can carry us, your children
<br>
that lament in a vow of silence.    </p>
<p><br></p>
